#Lumigram App (Quick & Dirty Instagram Clone)

So I decided to replicate the basic functions of the Instagram app using Ruby on Rails just for fun and some extra learning.

This was quick and dirty, so there were no tests, just me feeling my way through.

I'm more developer than designer so I didn't pay too much mind to how things look. I went with good old Bootstrap to make things look acceptable and just relied on the Glyphicons that come with it instead of hunting for the perfect icons.

Things that currently work:

* User Registration, Login & Account Update

* Creating, Editing & Deleting Posts

* Liking & Unliking

* Adding Comments

* Users need to be logged in to Post, Comment or Like


Things that need to be done:

* User Profiles that list each user's Posts

* Editing & Deleting Comments

* Following & Unfollowing
